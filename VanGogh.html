      <p>
        <strong><span class="name">Vincent van Gogh</span></strong> was a Dutch
        post-impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most
        famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. Before
        deciding to be a painter in 1880, he was an art dealer, teacher, and
        preacher. In a decade, he created about <strong>2,100 artworks</strong>.
        They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and
        are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive
        brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. He was not
        commercially successful, and his suicide, where he shot himself in the
        chest, at thirty-seven came after years of depression and poverty.
        <span class="name">His brother Theo</span>, who paid for everything he
        needed, inherited his collection. <br />At the link below you can find
        out more about him and also listen to the song
        <em><span class="name">"Vincent" by Don McLean</span></em> that was
        inspired by his painting "Starry Night".

      <p>
        I fell in love with his artwork in Amsterdam. There is a whole museum
        about him, where you can find next to his paintings also the letters he
        wrote to <span class="name">his brother Theo</span>.
        <br />
        Go and have a look by yourself, you might also fall in love.
